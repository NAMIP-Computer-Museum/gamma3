# JAVA emulator for the Gamma 3 first generation computer

## Introducting the Gamma 3
(source: http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/projet/gamma3/gamma3.htm)

First generation of electronic computers developped during WW2 (Colossus, ENIAC) and were based on available techni-ology: vacuum tubes (for processing) and delay line (for memory). Although quite different than our computers they quickly adhered to the Von Neumann architecture (defined in 1945). From the business perspective, computers were introduced in a context of mecanographic processing. 

In the US, before introducing the 701 computer, IBM developed electronic version of their electromechanical calculator, starting from the 603. The approach in France was different: Bull directly developed the Gamma 3 as a then modern computing unit. However, the first version (demonstrated i 1951) was first used as a slave tabulator equipment.
